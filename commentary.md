that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

Hyginus Chapter 30, Section 8

"Herclues led the bull, with whom pasphae had laid, alive from the island of Crete to Mycenae."

This work of art is a good representation of this passage. This passage emphasizes the bull being alive when he says *uiuum adduxit* and in the art, it is clear that the bull is giving some resistance (as a live bull would) to Hercules.
Additionally, the passages we've worked through the semester have highlighted Hercules strength. In this image of Hercules, the artist illustrates Hercules great physical strength that makes him the character he is in Hyginus.
Specifically in this passage, it takes a lot of strength to lead a live bull from Crete to Mycenae so it is no surprise that he is depicted this way in art.
