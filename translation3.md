Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

B. Grammatical questions
1. In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase
Iove is the abaltive and it is an ablative absolute construction.  

2. What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?
Stercus is the nominative becuase Stercus is the filth subject of the sentence. 

3. Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).
 Masculine, accusative, singular, 1. 

4. Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.
It is a participle and it is in the ablative because it is introducing a verbal idea. This is called the ablative absolute.  

5. What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?
Masculine, nominative, pluarl, and the antecedent are the four hourses. 

6. What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?
Nomina could be used as a noun but it could also be a verb in the imperfect. Since it is refering to what the horses were named, it is in the imperfect. 

C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

The participle *flumine admisso* works as an adverb that is describing the way the river moves. The reason it adds to passage's content because this participle says that the river is purifying the offenses. These offenses can't literally be washed away by the river but metaphorically speaking, the river can be something that symbolizes washing away of any impurities. For example, in Christianity, water represents cleansing away of original sin. 
The prepositional phrase, *cum abdero famulo* helps distinguish the use of cum in the reading. This changes the meaning of the clause.
