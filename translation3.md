Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

Passage to analyze
Hyginus, chapter 30, sections 7-9.

Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die purgavit, maiorem partem Iove adiutore; flumine admisso totum stercus abluit.

taurum cum quo Pasiphae concubuit ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum adduxit.

Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana vescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

Translation: 
In one day Hercules cleaned up the Manure of King Augea's stall the greater part with Jupiter as his partner; when the river had been let in he cleaned away all the dung. 
Hercules led the bull, with whom Pasphae had laid, alive from the island of Crete to Mycenae.
He killed Diomedes, the King of Thrace, and his four horses who used to eat human flesh along with abderus, his slave. The names of the horses were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus. 


A. Grammatical analysis
Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

>maiorem partem 
>>Iove adiutore;
>>flumine admisso 
>totum stercus *abluit*.

>taurum 
>>cum quo Pasiphae *concubuit* 
>ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum *adduxit*.

>Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, 
>>qui carne humana *vescebantur*,
>cum Abdero famulo *interfecit*;
>equorum autem *nomina* Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.


B. Grammatical questions
1. In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase?
Iove is the abaltive and it is an ablative absolute construction.  

2. What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?
Stercus is the accusative because the glossary notes that it can have two direct objects. 

3. Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).
 Feminine, accusative, singular, comparative degree. 

4. Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.
It is a participle and it is in the ablative because it is introducing a verbal idea. This is called the ablative absolute.  

5. What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?
Masculine, nominative, plural, and the antecedent are the four hourses. 

6. What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?
The verb missing would be erant. 

C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

The participle *flumine admisso* because it is describing the way the river moves and it's significance in washing away the manure. It adds to the passage because of water's significance in purification/cleansing. For example, in Christianity, water represents cleansing away of original sin. Additionally, the clause ex creta insula Mycenis vivum adduxit the fact that the adjective is towards the end of the sentence so it reveals that the bull is alive.
